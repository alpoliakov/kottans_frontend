## :heavy_check_mark: Task 0
- A great attempt to update knowledge on Git and GitHub;
- The course "How to Use Git and GitHub" is cognitive, well-structured, but the manner of teaching is very melancholic and frankly - boring;
- I prefer to use "Source Tree" from Atlassian;
--------------------
## :heavy_check_mark: Task 1
1. Linux Command Line Basics
- A great course to refresh your knowledge Linux Command Line Base and how the Linux
filesystem is organized;
- The thing I'll be using is, of course, setting up the server with VirtualBox (and of course - Linux Command Line );

2. Configuring Linux Web Servers
- The course gives basic understanding of linux systems administration is required to not only get your web
application up and running for the world to see, but also to ensure it continues operating efficiently.
This course was definitely difficult for me, but it's worth it to understand it.

3. Networking for Web Developers
- Great course! Excellent structured and prepared. Gives understanding фищге the TCP/IP stack, IP addressing,
DNS, and other protocols that underlie the Web technologies you use.
- In addition I want to recommend a course [Client-Server Communication](https://www.udacity.com/course/client-server-communication--ud897)
