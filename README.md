## :heavy_check_mark: Task 0
- A great attempt to update knowledge on Git and GitHub;
- The course "How to Use Git and GitHub" is cognitive, well-structured, but the manner of teaching is very melancholic and frankly - boring;
- I prefer to use "Source Tree" from Atlassian;
--------------------
## :heavy_check_mark: Task 1
### Courses:
>__1. Linux Command Line Basics__
- A great course to refresh your knowledge Linux Command Line Base and how the Linux
filesystem is organized;
- The thing I'll be using is, of course, setting up the server with VirtualBox (and of course - Linux Command Line );

>__2. Configuring Linux Web Servers__
- The course gives basic understanding of linux systems administration is required to not only get your web
application up and running for the world to see, but also to ensure it continues operating efficiently.
This course was definitely difficult for me, but it's worth it to understand it.

>__3. Networking for Web Developers__
- Great course! Excellent structured and prepared. Gives understanding about the TCP/IP stack, IP addressing,
DNS, and other protocols that underlie the Web technologies you use.
- In addition I want to recommend a course [Client-Server Communication](https://www.udacity.com/course/client-server-communication--ud897)

### Article:
>__"HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1"__
    and
>__"HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2"__

- The article is a good addition to the previous courses. Gives the concept of work HTTP  and tools to view HTTP traffic.
 It also helps when designing my network infrastructure and providing a great experience to me end users.
- This tour has given me a good taste for the breadth of HTTP and enough pointers to further explore this protocol.
- The article discusses the use of such Web Frameworks and Libraries as ExpressJS, Ruby on Rails, jQuery Ajax but for me it will
be interesting to study "Promise" based HTTP client for the browser and node.js: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

## :heavy_check_mark: Task 2
### Courses:
>__1. Version Control with Git__
- Again Git, really!? No,  newly!
- In fact, the course is excellent, it complements the courses that were passed before. For me it was useful to learn more about opportunities such as revert changes, or even delete commits. As well as work with organize your commits with tags.
- In the future I want to try to use such opportunities as: revert changes, organize my commits with tags, use git commit's --amend flag to alter the last commit, use git reset and git revert to undo and erase commits.

>__2. GitHub & Collaboration__
- Can be called continuation of the course "Version Control with Git" where you to learn to build projects collaboratively.
- In lesson 1, I did not learn anything new, but the following two gave excellent material for studying. That are "filtering collaborator's commits": __group commits by author with git shortlog__ (git shortlog, git shortlog -s -n, ), __filter commits with the --author flag__ (git log --author="******"), __filter commits using the --grep flag__ (git log --grep="bags"); "Determine how best to contribute to a project": __CONTRIBUTING.md File__, __GitHub Issues__, __Topic Branches__, __Best Practices__; "create a new remote with the __git remote add__ command"; using __squash commits__ (git rebase);
- All these tools I would like to use when working with projects.

## :heavy_check_mark: Task 3
### Course:
>__1. HTML and CSS Syntax (Intro to HTML & CSS)__
- As for the entry level study "HTML and CSS Syntax" is not bad. The course is inter-active, there are several tasks that must be completed.
- This course did not give me anything new. (Practice only).

--------------------

## :heavy_check_mark: Task 4
### Course:
>__1. Responsive Web Design Fundamentals__
- Good material for repetition. From the interesting - reasoning when and where to apply the transition points when using __Media Queries__ and of course, examples of use __Flexbox__ & __Pattern - Off Canvas__. It is interesting to work with responsive fonts however, unfortunately - not informative.
- Of the bad - did not present the technology __CSS Grid Layout__. It is sad.

## :heavy_check_mark: Task 5
### Course:
>__1. Intro to JavaScript__

- A good course for repeating the material and solving simple tasks. It's all.
- Thanks for the extra materials!

## :heavy_check_mark: Task 6
### Course:
>__1. Object-Oriented JavaScript__

- Probably need to write something and ... probably it will be: "I'm glad that in modern JavaScript there was an opportunity to do all this through classes."

>[Reference to the result of execution Task 6](Task_6/task06.md)

--------------------

## :heavy_check_mark: Task 7
### Course:
>__1. Offline Web Applications__

- After the course, mixed feelings remained. The course is full of information and is definitely complex, and in the event that a person has not faced Promises and working with databases, there will be "sadness and pain".
- The main thing I took for myself is the principles of working with Service Worker and IndexedDB.
