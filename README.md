## :heavy_check_mark: Task 0
- A great attempt to update knowledge on Git and GitHub;
- The course "How to Use Git and GitHub" is cognitive, well-structured, but the manner of teaching is very melancholic and frankly - boring;
- I prefer to use "Source Tree" from Atlassian;
--------------------
## :heavy_check_mark: Task 1
1. Linux Command Line Basics
- A great course to refresh your knowledge Linux Command Line Base and how the Linux
filesystem is organized;
- The thing I'll be using is, of course, setting up the server with VirtualBox (and of course - Linux Command Line );

2. Configuring Linux Web Servers
