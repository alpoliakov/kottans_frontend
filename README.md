## :heavy_check_mark: Task 0
- A great attempt to update knowledge on Git and GitHub;
- The course "How to Use Git and GitHub" is cognitive, well-structured, but the manner of teaching is very melancholic and frankly - boring;
- I prefer to use "Source Tree" from Atlassian;
--------------------
## :heavy_check_mark: Task 1
### Courses:
__1. Linux Command Line Basics__
- A great course to refresh your knowledge Linux Command Line Base and how the Linux
filesystem is organized;
- The thing I'll be using is, of course, setting up the server with VirtualBox (and of course - Linux Command Line );

__2. Configuring Linux Web Servers__
- The course gives basic understanding of linux systems administration is required to not only get your web
application up and running for the world to see, but also to ensure it continues operating efficiently.
This course was definitely difficult for me, but it's worth it to understand it.

__3. Networking for Web Developers__
- Great course! Excellent structured and prepared. Gives understanding фищге the TCP/IP stack, IP addressing,
DNS, and other protocols that underlie the Web technologies you use.
- In addition I want to recommend a course [Client-Server Communication](https://www.udacity.com/course/client-server-communication--ud897)

### Article:
__1. "HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1"__
    &
__2. "HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2"__

- The article is a good addition to the previous courses. Gives the concept of work HTTP  and tools to view HTTP traffic.
 It also helps when designing my network infrastructure and providing a great experience to me end users.
- This tour has given me a good taste for the breadth of HTTP and enough pointers to further explore this protocol.
- The article discusses the use of such Web Frameworks and Libraries as ExpressJS, Ruby on Rails, jQuery Ajax but for me it will
be interesting to study "Promise" based HTTP client for the browser and node.js: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).
